## Intro
I was excited that the Blue Yeti arrived in mail yesterday.
Because I am planning to stream programming and gaming I was looking for a proper microphone.
If you are interested in my stream you can head over to my [twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/marcelwalk).
So I got the Blue Yeti and on Friday the [Elgato Wave 1](https://www.elgato.com/en/wave-1) will arrive too. So I will write a short review on that too in the upcoming days!

## Looks
It's very heavy due to its 50s-style metal frame and the very solid metal base.
The matte black colour looks really nice, there are no sharp edges around the mic it is all very smooth.
The due to the heaviness and the foam on the bottom of the base the mic isn't moving around even on my slippery deskmat.

## Hardware Features
There's a volume knob for the live-monitoring headphone jack, a mute button, and a dial for switching patterns on the back, which selects between the four operating modes. The mute button is in good reach at the front of the mic and directly below it the volume know for the live-monitoring.
The mode selection dial is on the back of the mic so, if you have to switch modes frequently this can be very tedious

## Technical Specs

The Yeti features four recording patterns you can switch between (Cardioid, Stereo, Omnidirectional and Bidirectional). The resolution of the microphone is 16-bit at a sample rate of 48 kHz and a dynamic Range of 115 dB.

## Why I will return it
Don't get me wrong here, the Blue Yeti is a really outstanding mic both in its build quality and the recording quality
but I have issues with my empty recording room where the echo is pretty noticeable during my test streams where my headset mic performs a lot better.
Also the Elgato Wave Link software, which I already took a look at, for the previously mentioned Elgato Wave:1 is more fitting for me.
If you want to know why, wait for my Wave:1 review!

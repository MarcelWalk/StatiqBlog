# My First Entry / My Story

## Introduction

This is the first post of hopefully many, I'm writing this blog for many reasons.
The most important is to practice my writing and communication skills, as I'm not
really feeling that comfortable in writing and communicating.

Another reason is to share my knowlege, experiences and findings with you,
maybe I'll finish something for once, and honestly because I like to try new things!

## A Snapshot of the present

I'm a 23 year old, self tought Software developer originating from Germany.
In january I accepted a new job as a software developer at [Gamed mbH](https://www.gamed.com) in Graz,
where I work on customized software for manufacturing companies.

I still enjoy programming and learning new things in my free time, but most of the time I'm gaming and watching Netflix.

## My Past
Programming has been a hobby of mine for several years, First I started with Java then I moved to C#.
On my way I came in contact with many other programming languages like Python, JS, PHP, TS and GO.
All of this happened during middle school and my apprenticeship as a injection moulding technician,
sadly I noticed too late what my real passion was and during the apprenticeship I struggled a lot with depresssion.

So please do me a favour and **FOLLOW YOUR PASSION!**, If you don't you probably get ill over time.

So after I completed my apprenticeship in 2016, I took a while to recover from the damage the apprenticeship has caused, during that time I watched a lot of courses on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) and started looking for a Job as a developer.

In 2018 I finally reached my goal moved to Austria for a job as a developer.
In my job I wrote small bussiness applications that were used in the manufacturing of PCB's,
we also had a [MES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_execution_system) that I have extended with a few functionalities.
I were responsible for our GIT server (Azure DevOps / Team Foundation Server) and our Application Servers.

During that time I got introduced to linux and server administration, which I really enjoyed, and I'm still a big fan of the [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) because of its outsanding documentation and customizable nature.

For some reason nobody ever told me I got fired from that Job, which wasn't a bad thing because I thought about quitting anyways. This led to my current situation.

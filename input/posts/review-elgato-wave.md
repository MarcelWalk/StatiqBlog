## Intro
Since I have tested the Yeti microphone from Blue and wasn't really satisfied with the results, I was very curious if the Wave 1 could deliver better results. If you want to know more why the Yeti wasn't a fit for me [here](https://nyasaki.dev/posts/2021/02/review-blue-yeti/) is the review.

## Looks

The Wave one looks pretty minimal for me with a slight modern touch to it.Except the mesh the microphone is mostly made out of plastic which could feel a bit cheap, the stand is made out of metal.

## Hardware Features

It is connected via USB-C to USB cable, there is a 3.5 jack for headphones which can be used for live monitoring. Else than that
there is not much to the microphone itself, it features a knob which by default controls the volume of the headphone output and acts as a physical mute button when pressed but can be reassigned in the Wave Link software to control the gain of the microphone. Elgato includes a adapter for bigger threads so it can be used with a microphone arm out of the box.

## Technical Specs

It has a 17mm Electret capsule which records in the cardioid pattern. The resolution of the microphone is 24-bit at a sample rate of 48 kHz with a sensitivity of -25 dBFS and a dynamic Range of 115 dB. Elgato also advertises its internal pop filter and anti clipping technology.

## Accessories

There are several official accessories for the Wave:1.
There is a additional pop filter you can buy which costs around 30$ and a shock mount for around 40$. The rod is too short?
Elagto got you covered with extension rods for 10$ for a pair of 2, they are 58mm or 2.28in in length each.

## Is It Worth Buying?

I don't wanna give you a "depends" so here is my honest opinion about the microphone.
I tested it during my last stream and during several discord sessions, and for me it was definitely worth buying.
I have to say that both microphones had a hard time with me since there was a lot of echo in the background since my recording room is pretty empty, but the Wave:1 performed pretty well, a lot better than the Yeti.

So is it the right microphone for you?
Well if you are a gamer or streamer definitely, my setup proofed that It can handle pretty bad situations decently and It sounds a lot better than my Astro A20 headset and the sample rate of 48 kHz is perfectly fine for those use cases since OBS and other streaming applications are limited to this rate anyway. If you do a lot of voiceovers and other things that require a high sample rate you should take a look at the Wave:3
which has a sample rate of 96 kHz.
